    <p><i>How to learn and speak <b>Ukrainian</b> fluently</i></p>
    <hr size=1>
    <p>I gues this article lends itself to the question - why learn Ukrainian? Is it because of teh Russian war? And to that answer
      I say <em>no</em>. My journey to this slavic langauge actually initiall started as what was an interest in the culture and its people
      after visiting Ukraine for the first time in September 2022, as a medical student. Yes you heard that right - a medical student in one of
      Ukraine's oldes universities in a small town known as <i>Dnipropetskov or Dnipro</i> for short.
      <p>Sadly, things didn't work out and currently I am lost again, asking myself what is my purpose? What is my calling?</p>
      <p>Unfortunately I don't have the answer to this <strong><em>yet</em></strong> however one thing I am certain of is that my journey forged some
      strange kind of connection with this country and its people and, simply put, I can't stop thinking about the language and how different their culture and cuisine is from
      my "norm" - so, I ventured out and took on the challenge of learning Ukrainian, and this page will serve as my
      platform to share my journey.</p>
      <p>I also really want to learn Ukrainian so I can get my hands on some medical journals written by historically renowned physicians such
      as <i>Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov</i> -  Russia's titan of anatomy in the 19th century.</p>
